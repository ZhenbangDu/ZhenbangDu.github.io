  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={A transfer learning-based method for personalized state of health estimation of lithium-ion batteries},
  author={Ma, Guijun and Xu, Songpei and Yang, Tao and Du, Zhenbang and Zhu, Limin and Ding, Han and Yuan, Ye},
  journal={IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems},
  abstract={State of health (SOH) estimation of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is of critical importance for battery management systems (BMSs) of electronic devices. An accurate SOH estimation is still a challenging problem limited by diverse usage conditions between training and testing LIBs. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a transfer learning-based method for personalized SOH estimation of a new battery. More specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with an improved domain adaptation method is used to construct an SOH estimation model, where the CNN is used to automatically extract features from raw charging voltage trajectories, while the domain adaptation method named maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is adopted to reduce the distribution difference between training and testing battery data. This article extends MMD from classification tasks to regression tasks, which can therefore be used for SOH estimation. Three different datasets with different charging policies, discharging policies, and ambient temperatures are used to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method. The superiority of the proposed SOH estimation method is demonstrated through the comparison with direct model training using state-of-the-art machine learning methods and several other domain adaptation approaches. The results show that the proposed transfer learning-based method has wide generalizability as well as a positive precision improvement.},
