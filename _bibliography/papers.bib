  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={In the e-commerce realm, compelling advertising images are pivotal for attracting customer attention. While generative models automate image generation, they often produce substandard images that may mislead customers and require significant labor costs to inspect. This paper delves into increasing the rate of available generated images. We first introduce a multi-modal Reliable Feedback Network (RFNet) to automatically inspect the generated images. Combining the RFNet into a recurrent process, Recurrent Generation, results in a higher number of available advertising images. To further enhance production efficiency, we fine-tune diffusion models with an innovative Consistent Condition regularization utilizing the feedback from RFNet (RFFT). This results in a remarkable increase in the available rate of generated images, reducing the number of attempts in Recurrent Generation, and providing a highly efficient production process without sacrificing visual appeal. We also construct a Reliable Feedback 1 Million (RF1M) dataset which comprises over one million generated advertising images annotated by human, which helps to train RFNet to accurately assess the availability of generated images and faithfully reflect the human feedback. Generally speaking, our approach offers a reliable solution for advertising image generation.},

  journal={IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering},
  abstract={Cross-subject electroencephalogram (EEG) based seizure subtype classification is very important in precise epilepsy diagnostics. Deep learning is a promising solution, due to its ability to automatically extract latent patterns. However, it usually requires a large amount of training data, which may not always be available in clinical practice. This paper proposes Multi-Branch Mutual-Distillation (MBMD) Transformer for cross-subject EEG-based seizure subtype classification, which can be effectively trained from small labeled data. MBMD Transformer replaces all even-numbered encoder blocks of the vanilla Vision Transformer by our designed multi-branch encoder blocks. A mutual-distillation strategy is proposed to transfer knowledge between the raw EEG data and its wavelets of different frequency bands. Experiments on two public EEG datasets demonstrated that our proposed MBMD Transformer outperformed several traditional machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first work on knowledge distillation for EEG-based seizure subtype classification.},

  author={Deng, Lingfei and Zhao, Changming and Du, Zhenbang and Xia, Kun and Wu, Dongrui},
  journal={IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence},
  abstract={Semisupervised domain adaptation (SSDA) aims at training a high-performance model for a target domain using few labeled target data, many unlabeled target data, and plenty of auxiliary data from a source domain. Previous works in SSDA mainly focused on learning transferable representations across domains. However, it is difficult to find a feature space where the source and target domains share the same conditional probability distribution. Additionally, there is no flexible and effective strategy extending existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches to SSDA settings. In order to solve the above two challenges, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework, semisupervised transfer boosting (SS-TrBoosting). Given a well-trained deep learning-based UDA or SSDA model, we use it as the initial model, generate additional base learners by boosting, and then use all of them as an ensemble. More specifically, half of the base learners are generated by supervised domain adaptation, and half by semisupervised learning. Furthermore, for more efficient data transmission and better data privacy protection, we propose a source data generation approach to extend SS-TrBoosting to semisupervised source-free domain adaptation (SS-SFDA). Extensive experiments showed that SS-TrBoosting can be applied to a variety of existing UDA, SSDA, and SFDA approaches to further improve their performance.},

  journal={IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering},
  abstract={Epilepsy is a pervasive neurological disorder affecting approximately 50 million individuals worldwide. Electroencephalogram (EEG) based seizure subtype classification plays a crucial role in epilepsy diagnosis and treatment. However, automatic seizure subtype classification faces at least two challenges: 1) class imbalance, i.e., certain seizure types are considerably less common than others; and 2) no a priori knowledge integration, so that a large number of labeled EEG samples are needed to train a machine learning model, particularly, deep learning. This paper proposes two novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, Seizure-MoE and Mix-MoE, for EEG-based seizure subtype classification. Particularly, Mix-MoE adequately addresses the above two challenges: 1) it introduces a novel imbalanced sampler to address significant class imbalance; and 2) it incorporates a priori knowledge of manual EEG features into the deep neural network to improve the classification performance. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrated that the proposed Seizure-MoE and Mix-MoE outperformed multiple existing approaches in cross-subject EEG-based seizure subtype classification. Our proposed MoE models may also be easily extended to other EEG classification problems with severe class imbalance, e.g., sleep stage classification.},

  title={Overview of the winning approaches in 2022 world robot contest championship--asynchronous SSVEP},
  author={Du, Zhenbang and Bian, Rui and Wu, Dongrui},
  journal={Brain Science Advances},
  abstract={In recent years, the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) electroencephalogram paradigm has gained considerable attention owing to its high information transfer rate. Several approaches have been proposed to improve the performance of SSVEP-based brain–computer interface (BCI) systems. In SSVEP-based BCIs, the asynchronous scenario poses a challenge as the subjects stare at the screen without synchronization signals from the system. The algorithm must distinguish whether the subject is being stimulated or not, which presents a significant challenge for accurate classification. In the 2022 World Robot Contest Championship, several effective algorithm frameworks were proposed by participating teams to address this issue in the SSVEP competition. The efficacy of the approaches employed by five teams in the final round is demonstrated in this study, and an overview of their methods is provided. Based on the final score, this paper presents a comparative analysis of five algorithms that propose distinct asynchronous recognition frameworks via diverse statistical methods to differentiate between intentional control state and non-control state based on dynamic window strategies. These algorithms achieve an impressive information transfer rate of 89.833 and a low false positive rate of 0.073. This study provides an overview of the algorithms employed by different teams to address asynchronous scenarios in SSVEP-based BCIs and identifies potential future avenues for research in this area.},

  author={Ma, Guijun and Xu, Songpei and Yang, Tao and Du, Zhenbang and Zhu, Limin and Ding, Han and Yuan, Ye},
  journal={IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems},
  abstract={State of health (SOH) estimation of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is of critical importance for battery management systems (BMSs) of electronic devices. An accurate SOH estimation is still a challenging problem limited by diverse usage conditions between training and testing LIBs. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a transfer learning-based method for personalized SOH estimation of a new battery. More specifically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with an improved domain adaptation method is used to construct an SOH estimation model, where the CNN is used to automatically extract features from raw charging voltage trajectories, while the domain adaptation method named maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is adopted to reduce the distribution difference between training and testing battery data. This article extends MMD from classification tasks to regression tasks, which can therefore be used for SOH estimation. Three different datasets with different charging policies, discharging policies, and ambient temperatures are used to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method. The superiority of the proposed SOH estimation method is demonstrated through the comparison with direct model training using state-of-the-art machine learning methods and several other domain adaptation approaches. The results show that the proposed transfer learning-based method has wide generalizability as well as a positive precision improvement.},
